"""Turning a message from the core layers into a Qt dialog.

Code under `core/` must not import Qt, but it still has things a user has to be
told or asked. It takes a `report=` callback -- and, where an answer is needed,
a `confirm=` predicate -- and this module supplies the implementations that
raise an actual `QMessageBox`.

Both default to inert: `report=None` means "stay quiet" and a missing `confirm`
means "assume no", so a core function called from a worker, a test or the
standalone CLI never blocks on a dialog that has no one to answer it.
