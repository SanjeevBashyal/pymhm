"""What the plugin's workflow buttons actually run.

One subpackage per workflow: `morpho` for `pushButton_executeAllMorphology`,
`meteo` for `pushButton_executeMeteoMorphSetup`. These sequence the steps and
report progress; the computation itself lives in `core/morphology` and
`core/meteorology`, and anything the user must be told travels back through a
`report=` callback rather than a dialog these modules import.
