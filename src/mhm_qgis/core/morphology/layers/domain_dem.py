"""Write every domain DEM on the common L0 grid.

Delineation records each domain's mask but not its DEM, because the model
extent is not known until meteorology has fixed the L2 grid. Morphology Setup
then masks the cropped L0 DEM with each mask, so every `data/<domain>/dem.asc`
has the same matrix size as the shared morphology and meteorology inputs.
