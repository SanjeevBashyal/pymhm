"""Reading and writing the plugin's JSON, in one place.

Eight persisted files were being read and written by fourteen modules through
four idioms with a dozen small divergences -- four different `except` tuples on
the same read, three atomic writers differing in whether they wrote a trailing
newline or called `fsync`. The behaviour is preserved exactly; only the number
of copies changes.

Two things deliberately stay outside:

- the `job.json` / `result.json` pair is subprocess IPC in a temporary
  directory, written compact with no `indent` or `sort_keys`, and read by
  `native_worker` which runs without QGIS. Use `read_compact`/`write_compact`.
- `cache.fingerprint` serialises with `default=str` to canonicalise a hash
  input, not to persist. Changing that invalidates every cached stage result.
