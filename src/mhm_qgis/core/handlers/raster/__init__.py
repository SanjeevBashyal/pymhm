"""QGIS-free raster and watershed jobs, safe to run in a worker.

GDAL and NumPy only -- no QGIS, no Qt -- so these run inside a `QgsTask` or the
`native_worker` child process without dragging the QGIS runtime along. Flow
grids come from `applications/pyflwdir_handler`; this module writes the files.

Every L0 operation is an integer window copy with nodata padding, never a
resample: `crop_aligned_l0_raster` and `mask_aligned_l0_raster` raise on a
misaligned or wrong-CRS input rather than silently shifting the data.
