"""What a project has actually produced, and where to find it.

The question "is this output ready?" was answered four different ways: a bare
`os.path.exists` at ~150 call sites, a path-keyed JSON journal, a fingerprint
cache, and a handful of pure resolvers. This module is the one answer.

The filesystem stays authoritative -- the journal records what was produced and
when, but a file that has since been deleted is not available no matter what the
journal says. That ordering is deliberate: a user who clears an output folder
should see the plugin notice.
